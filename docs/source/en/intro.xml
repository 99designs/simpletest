			The <a local="simple_test">SimpleTest PHP unit tester</a> is in
			the 1.0.1 release cycle and is available for download from your nearest <a 
			href="http://souceforge.net/projects/simpletest/">SourceForge</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is a PHP unit test, mock objects and web test framework.
			Users of <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> will be
			familiar with most of the interface.
			<a href="http://jwebunit.sourceforge.net/">JWebUnit</a>
			style functionality is more complete now.
			It has support for SSL, frames, proxies, basic authentication and the
			standard HTML controls.
			The idea is that common but fiddly PHP tasks, such as logging into a site,
			can be tested easily.
		</p>
		<p>
            There is currently no support for JavaScript in the web tester.
            For testing these elements we recommend
            <a href="http://www.edwardh.com/jsunit/">JSUnit</a>
            or
            <a href="http://selenium.thoughtworks.com/index.html">Selenium</a>.
