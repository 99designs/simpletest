			The <a local="simple_test">SimpleTest PHP unit tester</a> has finally hit the
			1.0 mark and is available for download from your nearest <a 
			href="http://souceforge.net/projects/simpletest/">SourceForge</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is a PHP unit test and web test framework that has been built
			to be extensible in various ways.
			Users of <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> will be
			familiar with most of the interface.
			The test display is customisable as well as the base test
			case and in addition the mock objects can be used with other unit
			testers.

			<a href="http://jwebunit.sourceforge.net/">JWebUnit</a>
			style functionality is more complete now.
			It has support for SSL, frames, proxies, basic authentication and a wider
			range of HTML controls.
			The idea is that common but fiddly PHP tasks, such as logging into a site,
			can be tested easily.
