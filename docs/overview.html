            </p>
            <p>
                The heart of SimpleTest is a testing framework built around
                test case classes.
                These are written as extensions of base test case classes,
                each extended with methods that actually contain test code.
                Top level test scripts then invoke the <span class="new_code">run()</span>
                methods on every one of these test cases in order.
                Each test method is written to invoke various assertions that
                the developer expects to be true such as
                <span class="new_code">assertEqual()</span>.
                If the expectation is correct, then a successful result is dispatched to the
                observing test reporter, but any failure triggers an alert
                and a description of the mismatch.
            </p>
            <p>
                A <a href="unit_test_documentation.html">test case</a> looks like this...
<pre>
class <strong>MyTestCase</strong> extends UnitTestCase {
    function MyTestCase() {
        $this->UnitTestCase();
    }<strong>
    function testLog() {
        $log = new Log("my.log");
        $log->message("Hello");
        $this->assertTrue(file_exists("my.log"));
    }</strong>
}
</pre>
            </p>
            <p>
                These tools are designed for the developer.
                Tests are written in the PHP language itself more or less
                as the application itself is built.
                The advantage of using PHP itself as the testing language is that
                there are no new languages to learn, testing can start straight away,
                and the developer can test any part of the code.
                Basically, all parts that can be accessed by the application code can also be
                accessed by the test code if they are in the same language.
            </p>
            <p>
                The simplest type of test case is the
                <span class="new_code">UnitTestCase</span>.
                This class of test case includes standard tests for equality,
                references and pattern matching.
                All these test the typical expectations of what you would
                expect the result of a function or method to be.
                This is by far the most common type of test in the daily
                routine of development, making up about 95% of test cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                The top level task of a web application though is not to
                produce correct output from it&apos;s methods and objects, but
                to generate web pages.
                The <span class="new_code">WebTestCase</span> class tests web
                pages.
                It simulates a web browser requesting a page, complete with
                cookies and GET/POST parameters.
                With this type of test case, the developer can assert that
                information is present in the page and that forms and
                sessions are handled correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                A <a href="web_tester_documentation.html">web test case</a> looks like this...
<pre>
class <strong>MySiteTest</strong> extends WebTestCase {
    function MySiteTest() {
        $this->WebTestCase();
    }<strong>
    function testHomePage() {
        $this->get("http://www.my-site.com/index.php");
        $this->assertTitle("My Home Page");
        $this->clickLink("Contact");
        $this->assertTitle("Contact me");
        $this->assertWantedPattern("/Email me at/");
    }</strong>

                SimpleTest has a monthly release cycle.
                The following is a very rough outline of upcoming features
                and their expected point of release.
                I am afraid it is liable to change without warning as meeting the
                milestones rather depends on time available.
                Green stuff has been coded, but not necessarily released yet.
                If you have a pressing need for a green but unreleased feature
                then you should check-out the code from sourceforge CVS directly.

                Process is at least as important as tools.
                The type of process that makes the heaviest use of a developer&apos;s
                testing tool is of course
                <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">Extreme Programming</a>.
                This is one of the
                <a href="http://www.agilealliance.com/articles/index">Agile Methodologies</a>
                which combine various practices to "flatten the cost curve" of software development.
                More extreme still is <a href="http://www.testdriven.com/modules/news/">Test Driven Development</a>,
                where you very strictly adhere to the rule of no coding until you have a test.
                If your more of a planner or believe that experience trumps evolution,
                you may prefer the
                <a href="http://www.therationaledge.com/content/dec_01/f_spiritOfTheRUP_pk.html">RUP</a> approach.
                I haven&apos;t tried it, but even I can see that you will need test tools (see figure 9).
                Better yet, combine them into <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/publications/RUPvsXP.pdf">dX</a>

                Most unit testers clone <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> to some degree,
                as far as the interface at least. There is a wealth of information on the
                JUnit site including the
                <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/faq/faq.htm">FAQ</a>
                which contains plenty of general advice on testing.
                Once you get bitten by the bug you will certainly appreciate the phrase
                <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/testinfected/testing.htm">test infected</a>
                coined by Eric Gamma.
                If you are still reviewing which unit tester to use the main choices
                are <a href="http://phpunit.sourceforge.net/">PHPUnit</a>
                and <a href="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.php.phpunit.php">Pear PHP::PHPUnit</a>.
                They currently lack a lot of features found in
                <a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php">SimpleTest</a>, but the PEAR
                version at least is due for a major upgrade for PHP5.
            </p>
            <p>
                Library writers don&apos;t seem to ship tests with their code very often
                which is a shame.
                Library code that includes tests can be more safely refactored and
                the test code can act as additional documentation in a fairly standard
                form.
                This can save trawling the source code for clues when problems occour,
                especially when upgrading such a library.
                If you are hunting for testing examples in PHP libraries then there are a few exceptions.
                The <a href="http://ismo.sourceforge.net/">ISMO library for PHP</a> uses the
                PEAR unit tester and also includes a clever trick for mocking PHP functions.
                Libraries using SimpleTest for their unit testing include
                <a href="http://wact.sourceforge.net/">WACT</a> and
                <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/htmlsax">PEAR::XML_HTMLSax</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is currently a sad lack of material on mock objects, which is a shame
                as unit testing without them is a lot more work.
                The <a href="http://www.sidewize.com/company/mockobjects.pdf">original mock objects paper</a>
                is very Java focused, but still worth a read.
                As a new technology there are plenty of discussions and debate on how to use mocks,
                often on Wikis such as
                <a href="http://xpdeveloper.com/cgi-bin/oldwiki.cgi?MockObjects">Extreme Tuesday</a>
                or <a href="http://www.mockobjects.com/wiki/MocksObjectsPaper">www.mockobjects.com</a>
                or <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MockObject">the original C2 Wiki</a>.
                Injecting mocks into a class is the main area of debate for which this
                <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-mocktest.html">paper on IBM</a>
                makes a good starting point.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are plenty of web testing tools, but most are written in Java and
                tutorials and advice are rather thin on the ground.
                The only hope is to look at the documentation for
                <a href="http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/">HTTPUnit</a>,
                <a href="http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/">HTMLUnit</a>
                or <a href="">JWebUnit</a> and hope for clues.
                One interesting alternative is
                <a href="http://www.incanica.com/itp.html">ITP</a>.
                This framework uses XML to write the test cases, which is handy
                if your Java knowledge is limited (like mine).
                It still needs Java to run.
            </p>
            <p>
                For coarse benchmarking you can use <b>ab</b>, the Apache Benchmark, or a number
                of other
                <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Jakarta</a>
                testing tools.
                Apart from <b>ab</b>, you will probably have to have Java(tm) installed
                to use these alternatives.
                If you are not using Apache then you will have to read through
                your web server documentation or find a way to run your scripts
                from the command line to time them.
                End to end page timings are a very effective return on the time
                spent optimising. Once a page appears to be slow, breaking down
                the task timings to find bottlenecks can be a real challenge.

                For fine profiling of the PHP code base itself there are two
                alternatives, although both have install issues.
                The first is <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/apd">apd</a>
                (advanced PHP debugger) from the PEAR stable.
                The profiler comes as part of this debugging tool, but can
                be very slow to process the gathered data.
                The alternative <a href="http://www.xdebug.org/">XDebug</a>
                comes highly recommended, but I have not tried this tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                One very useful source of information though is you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, that&apos;s right, <strong>you</strong>!
            </p>
            <p>
                Almost everything you discover in the PHP testing field will be pretty new
                even if perhaps it was also recently disovered by somebody else.
                If you have an opinion on fine grain testing of web applications,
                I would <a href="mailto:marcus@lastcraft.com">love to hear from you</a>
                and so would everyone else.
                Together we can grope towards better practices and coach
                newcomers up to our self imposed coding standard -
                the one that says the code must at least work.
                I&apos;ll happily place any accumulated wisdom in
                <a href="http://www.lastcraft.com/">this site</a> manually until
                I can start a Blog, and I will of course credit you with suggestions.
                Even better, post suggestions on the popular PHP forums and
                spread the test infection far and wide.
            </p>

                Finally, if you are reading this after trying SimpleTest, then
                you probably already have a strong opinion of the toolkit.
                You can express that opinion (I won&apos;t be offended) in several
                places...

                or at least provide a work around.
