Simple Test
===========
A framework for unit testing, web site testing and mock objects. If you have
used JUnit you will find this PHP version very similar. Also included
is a mock objects generator. The mocks feature complete setting of
expected parameters with wildcards, selecting return values by parameter
again with wildcards and the setting of sequences of either.

The current release is PHP only and does not yet include the web testing tool.
As an early release it doesn't have much in the way of documentation either!
You can find a tutorial on http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php to
get you started. This material will eventually become included with the
project documentation.

If you download and use and possibly even extend this tool, please let me
know. Any feedback, even bad, is always welcome and I will work to get
your suggestions into the version one release.

yours, Marcus.
