Simple Test
===========
You probably got this package from...
http://sourceforge.net/projects/simpletest/

It's a framework for unit testing, web site testing and mock objects. If you have
used JUnit you will find this PHP version very similar. Also included
is a mock objects generator. The mocks feature a complete setting of
expected parameters with wildcards, selecting return values by parameter,
again with wildcards, and the setting of sequences of either.

The current release is PHP only and does not yet include the web testing tool.
As an early release it doesn't have much in the way of documentation either!
You can find a tutorial on http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php to
get you started. This material will eventually become included with the
project documentation.

If you download and use and possibly even extend this tool, please let me
know. Any feedback, even bad, is always welcome and I will work to get
your suggestions into the version one release.

You are looking at an Alpha release because the interfaces for the
web testing side have not yet stabilised. The unit tester and mock
object generator are tested and have already been used to test several
systems. And of course they are being used to assist creation
of SimpleTest itself.

There is no change log as yet. It would slow down development at
this stage and duplicate a lot of what can be found in the CVS
repostory in sourceforge. Once a version 1.0 is reached and the
interfaces are stable, I will document any subsequent interface
changes as best I can.

Oh, yes. It is called "Simple" because it should be simple to
use. I intend to add a complete set of tools for a test first
and "test as you code" type of development. "Simple" does not
mean "Lite" in this context.

yours, Marcus.
