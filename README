Simple Test
===========
You probably got this package from...
http://sourceforge.net/projects/simpletest/

It's a framework for unit testing, web site testing and mock objects. If you have
used JUnit you will find this PHP version very similar. Also included
is a mock objects and server stubs generator. The stubs can have return
values set for different arguments, can have sequences set also by
arguments and can return items by reference. The mocks inherit all of
this functionality and can also have expectations set, again in sequences
and for different arguments.

You are not tied to SimpleTest, though. The mocks and stubs will work
with other test frameworks and SimpleTest can use other framework's
(PHPUnit, PEAR::PhpUnit) test cases as it's own.

The current release is PHP only and does not yet include the web testing tool.
As an early release it doesn't have much in the way of documentation either!
You can find a tutorial on http://www.lastcraft.com/simple_test.php to
get you started and hopefully this material will eventually become included
with the project documentation.

If you download and use and possibly even extend this tool, please let me
know. Any feedback, even bad, is always welcome and I will work to get
your suggestions into the version one release.

You are looking at an Alpha release because the interfaces for the
web testing side have not yet stabilised. The unit tester and mock
object generator are tested and have already been used to test several
systems, although some of the method names are still settling down.
And of course they are being used to assist creation of SimpleTest itself.

There is no change log as yet except in CVS.

Oh, yes. It is called "Simple" because it should be simple to
use. I intend to add a complete set of tools for a test first
and "test as you code" type of development. "Simple" does not
mean "Lite" in this context; I wish I had given it a better name. :-(

yours, Marcus.

Thanks to Harry Fuecks for feedback, packaging and suggestions and also
for a great website (http://www.phppatterns.com/). :-)
