Simple Test interface changes
=============================
Because the SimpleTest tool set is still evolving it is likely that tests
written with earlier versions will fail with the newest ones. The most
dramatic changes are in the alpha releases. Here is a list of possible
problems.

No method submit()
==================
This has been renamed clickSubmit() in Beta1. The old method will
be removed after Beta1.

No method clearHistory()
========================
This method is deprecated in Beta2.

No method getCallCount()
========================
This method has been deprecated since Beta1 and has now been
removed. There are now more ways to set expectations on counts
and so this method should be unecessery.

Cannot find file *
==================
The following public name changes have occoured...

simple_html_test.php --> reporter.php
simple_mock.php --> mock_objects.php
simple_unit.php --> unit_tester.php
simple_web.php --> web_tester.php

The old names are deprecated in Alpha8 and are removed in Beta1.

No method attachObserver()
==========================
Prior to the Alpha8 release the old internal observer pattern was
gutted and replaced with a visitor. This is to trade flexibility of
test case expansion against the ease of writing user interfaces.

Code such as...

$test = &new MyTestCase();
$test->attachObserver(new TestHtmlDisplay());
$test->run();

...should be rewritten as...

$test = &new MyTestCase();
$test->run(new HtmlReporter());

If you previously attached multiple observers then the workaround
is to run the tests twice, once with each, until they can be combined.
For one observer the old method is simulated in Alpha 8, but is
removed in Beta1.

No class TestHtmlDisplay
========================
This class has been renamed to HtmlReporter in Alpha8. It is supported,
but deprecated and will be removed in Beta1. If you have subclassed
the display for your own design, then you will have to extend this
class instead.

If you have accessed the event queue by overriding the notify() method
then I am afraid you are in big trouble :(. The reporter is now
carried around the test suite by the runner classes and the methods
called directly. In the unlikely event that this is a problem then
simplest is to write your own runner class and invoke the tests with...

$test->accept(new MyRunner(new MyReporter()));

...rather than the run method.

Missing set options method
==========================
All test suite options are now in one class called SimpleTestOptions.
This means that options are set differently...

GroupTest::ignore() --> SimpleTestOptions::ignore()
Mock::setMockBaseClass() --> SimpleTestOptions::setMockBaseClass()

These changed in Alpha8 and the old versions are now removed.

No method setExpected*()
========================
The mock expectations changed their names in Alpha4 and the old names
ceased to be supported in Alpha8. The changes are...

setExpectedArguments() --> expectArguments()
setExpectedArgumentsSequence() --> expectArgumentsAt()
setExpectedCallCount() --> expectCallCount()
setMaximumCallCount() --> expectMaximumCallCount()

The parameters remained the same.
